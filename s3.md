# S3.  What is BlockChain

> For Intuitive Understanding of BlockChain

## What is Block(Data)

What does the blockchain consist of..

**Block == Record**

so, Data in Block.

**Block Component**

1. Data
2. Prev. Hash
3. Hash

Before we know Prev.Hash, Let’s first look at Genesis Block

Genesis Block is the only block without Prev.Hash, and the value of this is 00000…

**Hash Value of Block1  == Block2’s Prev. Hash Value** 

so, the reason why Blockchain’s name is BlockChain,

⇒ t**he blocks are connected by an encryption link through the hash values above.**

### Blocks are cryptographically linked together

This is the very basic concept of blockchain..

From now on.. I have to know about *“Mining, Distributed P2P Network, Immutable Ledger, Hash Cryptography, Consensus Protocol..”*
